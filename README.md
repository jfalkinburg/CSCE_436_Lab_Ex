# This is an example copy of your Repo
## You will have a directory structure that contains a directory for each Homework, Lecture, and Lab and looks like this:
- /LabX (project folder)
    - Do not create a code folder in the project folder.  Leave the code where the IDE puts within the project folder and don't move the code around.
    - /images
        - Include all images you use in your notebook here
    - /docs
		- Include this if you are adding other documents to your project
	- README.md
        - Lab notes not included in your git commit history	/LabX/code
		- If you name the file README.md it will be previewed in the git folder when looking at the code.
