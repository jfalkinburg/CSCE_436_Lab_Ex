### Objectives or Purpose 
This should include a paragraph on what is the goal of this assignment?

Remember, the purpose of the lab notebook is to communicate EVERYTHING you have done in pursuit of a particular project.  If you are sitting on the bus scribbling on the back of an envelope about your lab design, take a picture of that and include it with your work.  Without adequate documentation, your instructor won’t know what your thought process was and will not be able to grade you properly.  Once you leave the school environment, fellow engineers may need to pick up your project where you left off if you PCA, PCS, get hospitalized, or otherwise find yourself no longer working on something.  You will save your employer/co-workers/replacement a lot of time and money if you have left a detailed record for them to easily understand what you were doing, the approach you took, the tests you performed, and what you learned.

### Preliminary design
How will you start attacking the problem?
This should include detailed instructions of what you are about to do.  It may include PreLab material and also information from the Lab Handout.  Use pictures and data from Lab Handout.
You may also use snippets of code in here as well:

#### Code:

**You should only include important key code snippets in your README.  All code files should be included in code folder.**

**Well-formatted code**
 - All of your code should be written with:
    1. headers
    2. comments
    3. good coding practices.


##### Sample Code Headers
The following are *example* headers, but your instructor may require a different template to be used.

**Assembly Header:**

	; Purpose:  This program is a demonstration of using the CCS IDE to
	; program, assemble, flash, and debug the MSP430.
	; 
	; Documentation: none

	-- assisted me in brain storming, debugging and validating this program, 
	-- the program itself is my own work. I understand that submitting code 
	-- which is the work of other individuals is a violation of the honor   
	-- code.  I also understand that if I knowingly give my original work to 
	-- another individual is also a violation of the honor code.

### Software flow chart or algorithms
All coding include a pseudocode flow charts and algorithms defined your code and the algorithms used.  Visio or PowerPoint works well for this!

#### Pseudocode:
Insert pseudocode or flowchart here.

### Hardware schematic
If you are wiring things up you will need to create a schematic for your design.

### Debugging
You should be keeping track of issues as you go along.  I didn't have any problems is not a good answer.  Describe the problems you had and what you did to fix it.  Again this is where I would say commit early and often and start your notebook when you start your code.

### Testing methodology or results
Detail the steps in getting the results you system is designed to achieve.  Have enough detail that someone can come behind and reproduce your results.

Display your results and describe them in detail so that anyone can understand.  For example Figure 1 below shows a screenshot of a memory dump for RAM from 0x0200 to 0x024E.  You will also describe to the reader what they are looking at.

##### Figure 1: Memory Dump Label (Always include figure AND table labels!)

### Answers to Lab Questions
Here is where you would answer any lab questions given in the lab writeup.

### Observations and Conclusions
During this whole assignment, what did you learn?  What did you notice that was noteworthy?  This should be a paragraph starting with the purpose, whether or not you achieved that purpose, what you learned, and how you can use this for future labs.

### Documentation
– always include this.  Any help received on any portion of the assignment, even from an instructor or the internet should be specifically mentioned.
